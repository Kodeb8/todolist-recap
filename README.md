# todolist-recap

This is the "todo list" from the Angela Yu course. However, this is the "recap", as in, this was me re-making what I did in the course, but without the videos. I mostly did this just remembering what it was I did on the course, just to see if I actually learned it. I did have to check my previous project filea a few times, but for the most part, I managed to recreate it by myself.
